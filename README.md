PowerShell Assorted Scripts
=================

Miscellaneous PowerShell scripts I've built to automate tasks at home and with my personal projects

* `thumbs.ps1` : Grabs all JPG files from current folder, generates a thumbnail in a subfolder,
and stores a thumbs.list file containing all original file name and thumbnail filename.

* `watermarking.ps1` : Grabs all JPG files from current folder and a png called watermark.png and adds the watermark
to every image, storing a copy in a subfolder.
